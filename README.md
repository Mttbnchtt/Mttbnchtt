Matteo Bianchetti (@Mttbncht)

I work as an ontologist and knowledge graph engineer. Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-bianchetti-06703916a/).
I mostly work with RDF graphs for classification and reasoning. I am getting more experience with machine learning and
labeled property graphs. 

I am interested in philosophy (especially philosophy of mathematics) and mathematics (especially logic).
I published on [infinite time Turing machines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-019-00692-9) and
on the application of RDF graphs to the study of the properties of [mathematical proofs](https://github.com/Mttbnchtt/ontology-and-proofs).

Reach out if you are looking to collaborate (the information to contact me is in the resume).
